## A little about me

I'm a student striving to become a web developer / software engineer.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a realtime multiplayer tic-tac-toe server, written in go and react

- ðŸŒ± I'm always looking for new and exciting technologies to learn.  At the moment it's learing golang.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my Neovim plugin to help web developers convert between measurement units and color units.
